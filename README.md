# Building my own Blockchain

I built my own Blockchain in Python and was able to interact with it and make crypto transactions to different nodes using Postman Get, Post Requests

I used Proof of Stake for consensus and was able to mine the blocks using the nodes.





  
## What the Blockchain does

- Initialises the chain with a Genesis Block
- Records the transactions in the ( memo ) and add it to the next block
- Mines the Block using Proof of stake.
- Each Block contains Timestamp, proof , Hash of the previous Block and Transactions on the network.
- The miner recieves awards for mining the block and all other transactions are verified.
- The longest chain is dominant and replaces all the smaller ones
- Interact with the Blockchain using get / post requests in flask using Postman.




## Optimizations

The performance of the network can be optimised using different consensus algorithms such as

- Proof of Stake
- Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT)
- Proof of Storage
- Proof of Burn
- Proof of elapsed time
